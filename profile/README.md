# Robotics & Autonomous Manufacturing Systems (RAMS) Lab

## Introduction

Welcome to the Robotics & Autonomous Manufacturing Systems Lab, known as RAMS Lab! We are a robotics-focused lab at The University of Sheffield working on decision-making and control algorithms to enable robust autonomy in applications ranging from manufacturing, aerospace, agriculture and construction. Our members come from a wide variety of academic backgrounds and are affiliated with Sheffield Robotics.  

As a lab, we focus on enabling a grass-roots approach by granting opportunities to undergraduate students to take part in novel research alongside experienced postgraduate students and academic staff. Our lab focuses on manipulator-based planning and control, embedded control for CNC machining, and manufacturing process monitoring. We also have projects focusing on mobile robotics, computer vision, and digital twin technologies.
